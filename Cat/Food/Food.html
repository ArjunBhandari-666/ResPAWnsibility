                <span class="textforrh">Cats need to be fed a minimum of 2 meals a day with 12 hour gaps  between them. A breakfast, lunch and dinner schedule is an equally great option. This way, the cat wont go to long without food. Kittens that are 8 to 12 weeks old require 4 meals a day. kittens 3 to 6 months require 3 meals a day. After that you decide to either give your cat 2 or 3 meals a day. Some dogs may require more meals than that. You will have to consult your veterinarian for your cat.
