                    1. Propper Nutrition is important. Feeding your pet the right amount and type of food helps him maintain a healthy weight, which is one of the best ways to prevent obesity-related illnesses and extend his/her lifespan.

                    2. Provide a Sufficient Number of Litter Boxes. A good rule of thumb is to have one litter box per kitty, plus an additional one. So if you have three cats, you should set up four boxes. You'll want to think carefully about where those boxes go. </span>

                    3. Regular Checkups are important. An annual health checkup provides the best opportunity for your vet to perform a variety of health tests that can lead to early detection of diseases and to spot warning signs of serious illness. Yearly dental appointments may also be recommended to remove plaque and tartar buildup.</span>

                    4. Affection is important. Establishing a strong bond with your cat is good for both of you. Cuddles, petting and even brushing his/her coat are great ways to show your pet some love. Not only does this strengthen the emotional connection with your pet, but it promotes your pet having positive interactions with other animals and humans.</span>

                    5. Know what’s “normal.” Has your pet’s behavior changed recently? Is he scratching more than usual? Is he eating more or less than he normally does? Changes from the norm could be cause for concern and indicate an underlying issue. If you notice abnormal behavior in your cat, give your vet a call to see if an exam is necessary.</span>
