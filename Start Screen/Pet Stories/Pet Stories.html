I did the natural thing and googled it. Then I found out about Respawnsibilities. I read throught the website then I learned what to do. Without Respawnsibilities I still wouldn’t know what to do with my puppy. </span></div>

Then finially one day, I searched online for a website to help me to take care of my cat. Without Respawnsibilities I would probably be giving my cat steak dinners and giving him baths twice a day, but thanks to Respawnsibilities. I know what to do. </span></div>
